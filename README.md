# SKYHACK-2.0 (UNITED AIRLINES CUSTOMER SUPPORT ANALYSIS)

# Problem Statement
As United Airlines continues its journey to become the best airline in the history of aviation, it is crucial to provide world-class customer service, for which one of the key areas of focus is our call center operations. Call centers play a critical role in ensuring customer issues are resolved quickly and efficiently, but we face challenges in improving metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST).

Your task is to optimize these key call center metrics, helping reduce resolution times and providing faster, more efficient service to our customers. You are required to analyze our existing call center data to identify inefficiencies, determine the drivers of long AHT and AST, and suggest strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce escalations, and improve overall operational efficiency.

# Background
In todayâ€™s competitive airline industry, providing efficient and reliable customer service is crucial for customer retention and loyalty. Our call center, which handles customer inquiries, complaints, and service requests, is an essential touchpoint for many of our passengers. However, the growing demand and complexity of services have made it increasingly important to optimize the operations of this critical channel.
